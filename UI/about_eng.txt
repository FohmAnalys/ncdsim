"NCD-SIM is a simulation model for projecting the occurence of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Swedish population, under varying assumptions of how population-level risk factors such as smoking evolve over time. NCD-SIM is developed by the Public Health Agency of Sweden in collaboration with the Swedish Cancer Society and the Swedish Heart Lung Foundation."

"The model population is based on Swedish population register data from Statistics Sweden (the LISA database). Data on disease cases are from the Swedish cancer and patient registers of the National Board of Social Affairs and Health. Prevalences of non-dietary risk factors are based on the National public health survey of the Public Health Agency. Prevalences of dietary risk factors are based on the national survey Riksmaten of the Swedish Food Agency. Relative risks associated with risk factors are based on Freisling et al. (2020), Garcia et al. (2020), Yi-Jie Wang et al. (2020) and Global Burden of Disease 2019 (2020)."
